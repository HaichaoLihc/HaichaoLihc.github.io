            <p class="detail-description hidden" id="description1">On April 13, 2023, I took 384 photographs in Nanhaizi Park. Shuttling sometimes amid the crowd and sometimes amid still and solitary park landscape, I made both random snapshots and meticulously composed photographs.
The first impression of the park is complicated. The layout of the park, the tourists, the flowers, trees, light, and everything on its surface are familiar to me, as they are similar in almost every park in Beijing. What is unfamiliar is how I was related to this place and my detached curiosity to the lines, shapes, lights and shadows constructing this place. Traveling far away from home, sleeping my way to the destination, and tripping with a bunch of strangers, I felt like I was in a dream. And the blinding sunlight, intense contrast between light and shadow amplify the dreamlike ambience, compelling me to focus my lens on the abstract forms.</p>

             <p class="detail-description hidden" id="description3">My family frequently moves house, and each time when packing my stuff, I hesitate to decide which to throw away and which to bring along. Yet after countless experiences of moving house, I found that there are always some objects that I won’t discard no matter how useless they are. Then I asked myself “why do you keep them even though they are of no use to you?” I interviewed my friends about this question and found that they are bothered by the same problem. I collected and photographed these objects.
It seems that objects can connect us to our past or can somehow repre- sent our past. Compare to our physical body which is constantly refreshing itself through metabolism, objects kept more scars, marks, and traces of usage. This makes them permanent monuments of our bygone life. No one can live without one’s past. We probably wouldn’t notice these objects in our daily life. They are quiet, lying in our bottom drawer, hiding in the corner of our closet. Yet when I zoom in on these objects, when every single scratch is salient, what happened to these objects becomes more visible and detailed. And we are reminded of our past.</p>
