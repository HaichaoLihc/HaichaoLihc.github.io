      "description": "This piece was captured between 2021 and 2023. I compiled the photographs taken on my high school campus upon graduation to create this piece. The inspiration for the title comes from one afternoon during my junior year, nearing summer vacation, when I sat alone by the window at the back of the classroom. The sunlight spilled into this campus that often filled me with worry and even disdain, yet on that day, it filled me with an unprecedented sense of joy and peace. Perhaps I could forever immerse myself in the warmth of some afternoon sun...\n\nAs graduation approached, I suddenly felt compelled to bring these photos together. As I was about to leave the campus, it seemed as though there was a new connection between the landscapes of the school. This book tells the story of how I connected with this place and how we changed together.",

      "description": "A river runs through these pictures as it runs through our lives.\n\nLife is depicted as a dance, the type of dance that the dancer creates her choreography along the music. If life is a dance, then the music of time is the constraint, since we cannot control time or the context in which we are born. The point is that we have to invent our own steps against this backdrop. As we invent our steps, we keep moving and changing.\n\nIt's there and it's gone.\n\nMoving and changing is the living beauty of our life, since life is not some static product. The photographs in this book is not static, not depicting the decisive moments in our movements, but fluid, sporadically hinting people's movements.\n\nThe verb \"brighten\" implies that the eye is always catching a new idea from which it can make up a new step. After we did one step we wonder what shall we do next and our eyes are brightened and we continue to do steps.\n\nBetween those casual moments runs a river which is the river of life. I hope the way the river fills the gap between pictures can inspire people to imagine what steps or movements are these people doing and what have brightened their eyes and what steps follow next.\n\nThe sunlight hits the river and is reflected as starlight. The river of time or the music of time carries us forward, and we catch the light crumbled up by the movement of river to create our steps.",

      "description": "On April 13, 2023, I took 384 photographs in Nanhaizi Park. Shuttling sometimes amid the crowd and sometimes amid still and solitary park landscape, I made both random snapshots and meticulously composed photographs.\n\nThe first impression of the park is complicated. The layout of the park, the tourists, the flowers, trees, light, and everything on its surface are familiar to me, as they are similar in almost every park in Beijing. What is unfamiliar is how I was related to this place and my detached curiosity to the lines, shapes, lights and shadows constructing this place. Traveling far away from home, sleeping my way to the destination, and tripping with a bunch of strangers, I felt like I was in a dream. And the blinding sunlight, intense contrast between light and shadow amplify the dreamlike ambience, compelling me to focus my lens on the abstract forms.",

      "description": "My family frequently moves house, and each time when packing my stuff, I hesitate to decide which to throw away and which to bring along. Yet after countless experiences of moving house, I found that there are always some objects that I won't discard no matter how useless they are. Then I asked myself \"why do you keep them even though they are of no use to you?\" I interviewed my friends about this question and found that they are bothered by the same problem. I collected and photographed these objects.\n\nIt seems that objects can connect us to our past or can somehow represent our past. Compare to our physical body which is constantly refreshing itself through metabolism, objects kept more scars, marks, and traces of usage. This makes them permanent monuments of our bygone life. No one can live without one's past. We probably wouldn't notice these objects in our daily life. They are quiet, lying in our bottom drawer, hiding in the corner of our closet. Yet when I zoom in on these objects, when every single scratch is salient, what happened to these objects becomes more visible and detailed. And we are reminded of our past.",
