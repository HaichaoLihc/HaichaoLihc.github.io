            <h5>Description</h5>
            <p>
                This piece was captured between 2021 and 2023. I compiled the photographs taken on my high school campus
                upon graduation to create this piece. The inspiration for the title comes from one afternoon during my
                junior year, nearing summer vacation, when I sat alone by the window at the back of the classroom. The
                sunlight spilled into this campus that often filled me with worry and even disdain, yet on that day, it
                filled me with an unprecedented sense of joy and peace. Perhaps I could forever immerse myself in the
                warmth of some afternoon sun...
            </p>
            <p>As graduation approached, I suddenly felt compelled to bring these photos together. As I was about to
                leave the campus, it seemed as though there was a new connection between the landscapes of the school.
                This book tells the story of how I connected with this place and how we changed together.

        <div>
            <h5>Description</h5>
            <p>A river runs through these pictures as it runs through our lives.
                Life is depicted as a dance, the type of dance that the dancer creates her choreography along the music.
                If life is a dance, then the music of time is the constraint, since we cannot control time or the
                context in which we are born. The point is that we have to invent our own steps against this backdrop.
                As we invent our steps, we keep moving and changing.
                It’s there and it’s gone.</p>
            <p>Moving and changing is the living beauty of our life, since life is not some static product. The
                photographs in this book is not static, not depicting the decisive moments in our movements, but fluid,
                sporadically hinting people’s movements.
                The verb “brighten” implies that the eye is always catching a new idea from which it can make up a new
                step. After we did one step we wonder what shall we do next and our eyes are brightened and we continue
                to do steps.
            </p>
            <p>Between those casual moments runs a river which is the river of life. I hope the way the river fills the
                gap between pictures can inspire people to imagine what steps or movements are these people doing and
                what have brightened their eyes and what steps follow next.
                The sunlight hits the river and is reflected as starlight. The river of time or the music of time
                carries us forward, and we catch the light crumbled up by the movement of river to create our steps.</p>
